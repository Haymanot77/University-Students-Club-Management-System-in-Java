# University Students Club Management System

Welcome to the University Students Club Management System repository! 

This project is a desktop application built using **Java** and **MySQL** that allows university club representatives to efficiently manage student clubs. The system handles various club activities such as member management and recording meeting minutes .


## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Database**: MySQL (used for persistent storage of all data)
- **Tools and Frameworks**:
  - JDBC for database connectivity
  - Maven for dependency management 



## Learning Objectives

This project helped me:

- Understand the integration of Java applications with a relational database.
- Explore concepts of CRUD operations using JDBC.
- Develop skills in software architecture and modular programming.

## Future Improvements

Some potential enhancements:

- Implement role-based access control (e.g., admin vs. regular user permissions).
- Add a web-based version for broader accessibility.
